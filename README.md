### Hello! 👋👋👋
Glad you stumbled upon my humble space in the ☁

I have these projects going for me right now, so do get in touch (anikethsuresh at gmail dot com) if you'd like to collaborate!

1. Getting out a Youtube course in Computer Vision💻🤖. Having taken Computer Vision (graduate level) in university, I was saddened to note the lack of easy to understand material on computer vision, therefore the intention behind the course.
2. Solutions to LeetCode/ HackerRank problems📒. I'm in the process of looking for a job, and I'm sure that if this can help me, it will surely help someone else as well!

Well, that's about all, for now!

Thanks for stopping by!
